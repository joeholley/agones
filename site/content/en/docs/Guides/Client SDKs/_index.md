## Overview

The client SDKs are required for a game server to work with Agones.

The current supported SDKs are:

- [Unreal Engine]({{< relref "unreal.md" >}})
- [Unity]({{< relref "unity.md" >}})
- [C++]({{< relref "cpp.md" >}})
- [C#]({{< relref "csharp.md" >}})
- [Node.js]({{< relref "nodejs.md" >}})
- [Go]({{< relref "go.md" >}})
- [Rust]({{< relref "rust.md" >}})
- [REST]({{< relref "rest.md" >}})

You can also find some externally supported SDKs in our 
[Third Party Content]({{% ref "/docs/Third Party Content/libraries-tools.md#client-sdks" %}}).

Most SDKs are relatively thin wrappers around [gRPC](https://grpc.io) generated clients. However, in cases 
where gRPC client generation and compilation isn't well supported, the SDK may instead be using the REST API exposed via [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway)) .

The SDK connects to a small process that Agones coordinates to run alongside the Game Server
in a Kubernetes [`Pod`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/).
This means that more languages can be supported in the future with minimal effort
(but pull requests are welcome! ðŸ˜Š ).

There is also [local development tooling]({{< relref "local.md" >}}) for working against the SDK locally
without having to spin up an entire Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Connecting to the SDK Server

Starting with Agones 1.1.0, the port that the SDK Server listens on for incoming gRPC or HTTP requests is
configurable. This provides flexibility in cases where the default port conflicts with a port that is needed
by the game server.

Agones will automatically set the following environment variables on all game server containers:

* `AGONES_SDK_GRPC_PORT`: The port where the gRPC server is listening (defaults to 9357)
* `AGONES_SDK_HTTP_PORT`: The port where the grpc-gateway is listening (defaults to 9358)

The SDKs will automatically discover and connect to the gRPC port specified in Agones config by reading the environment variable.

If your game server cannot use any of the provided SDK clients and instead directly makes REST calls to the SDK server using an generic HTTP client, 
we recommend configuring your HTTP client to connect using the port from the `AGONES_SDK_HTTP_PORT` environment variable in case the SDK server is configured to listen on a different port.

## Function Reference

While each of the SDKs are canonical to their languages, they all have the following
functions that implement the core responsibilities of the SDK.

For language specific documentation have a look at the respective source (linked above) 
and the {{< ghlink href="examples" >}}examples{{< /ghlink >}}.

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning">}}
Calling any of state-changing functions mentioned below does not guarantee that the `GameServer` Custom Resource object in Kubernetes will actually change its state immediately. For instance, if another event (such as a fleet scaling down) moves the GameServer to the `Shutdown` state while your SDK function is being processed, this could lead to your SDK call having no effect. If your approach depends on state transitions, you should verify the SDK call resulted in your desired pod state with callbacks by using the `WatchGameServer()` function.
{{< /alert >}}

Functions which change `GameServer` state or settings are:

1. `Ready()`
1. `Shutdown()`
1. `SetLabel()`
1. `SetAnnotation()`
1. `Allocate()`
1. `Reserve()`
1. `Alpha().SetCapacity()`
1. `Alpha().PlayerConnect()`
1. `Alpha().PlayerDisconnect()`

### Lifecycle Management

#### Ready()
Tells Agones that the game server is ready to take player connections.
This updates the Kubernetes `GameServer` record to the `Ready` state, and poulates the public 
IP address and connection port.

The preferred pattern is to call `Shutdown()` once a game has completed, and allow your defined 'fleet' and 'fleetAutoScaler' resources to start a new `GameServer` as necessary, which allows Agones to enforce the [scheduling policy]({{% ref "/docs/Advanced/scheduling-and-autoscaling.md" %}}) you've selected. 
This SDK call can also [change an `Allocated` `GameServer` back to the `Ready` state to be available for allocation again]({{% ref "/docs/Integration Patterns/reusing-gameservers.md" %}}), if this is a better fit for your usage pattern.

#### Health()
Sends a heartbeat to the SDK to designate that the `GameServer` is alive and
healthy. Failure to send heartbeats within the threshold configured in the `health` section of the 
`GameServer` spec will result in the `GameServer` being marked as `Unhealthy`. 

See the {{< ghlink href="examples/gameserver.yaml" >}}gameserver.yaml{{< /ghlink >}} for all health checking
configurations.

#### Reserve(seconds)

With some matchmaking systems, just-in-time allocation of game servers when a match is found is not a good fit. A common approach for these systems 'registers' a game server with the matchmaker while the search for a match is in progress.  The [Matchmaker registration pattern]({{% ref "/docs/Integration Patterns/matchmaker-registration.md" %}}) covers this style of matchmaker in more detail. For this use-case, Agones has the `Reserve(seconds)` SDK function, which:
*  Prevents the server from being deleted 
*  Signals to other systems that this server is in consideration by the matchmaker
*  **Crucially, will never** trigger a `FleetAutoscaler` scale up event, the way an `Allocate` call could 
The function accomplishes this by moving the `GameServer` into the `Reserved` state for the specified number of seconds (0 is forever), after which Agones moves it back to `Ready` state. While in `Reserved` state, the `GameServer` will not be deleted during a scale down or `Fleet` update event, and also it will not be returned when an external system requests a [GameServerAllocation]({{% ref "/docs/Reference/gameserverallocation.md" %}}) from the Agones controller.  

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
To move a `GameServer` from `Reserved` to `Allocated` in this pattern, the **game server itself** should call `SDK.Allocate()`.  Note that state-changing SDK commands such as `Allocate()` or `Ready()` will attempt to update the state immediately, disregarding any timeout specified in a previous `Reserve(seconds)` call.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Allocate()

With some matchmaking strategies, game servers need to mark themselves as `Allocated`.
For those scenarios, Agones has the `Allocate()` SDK function.

The `agones.dev/last-allocated` annotation on the GameServer will be set to an RFC3339-formatted timestamp of the time of allocation, even if the GameServer was already in an `Allocated` state.

Note that if your usage pattern involves game servers using `SDK.Allocate()` in combination with external systems requesting [GameServerAllocation]({{% ref "/docs/Reference/gameserverallocation.md" %}}) from the Kubernetes API, it's possible for the `agones.dev/last-allocated` timestamp to move backwards if clocks are not synchronized between the Agones controller and the GameServer pod.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
Although game servers **can** mark themselves as allocated using this SDK function, requesting a 
[GameServerAllocation]({{% ref "/docs/Reference/gameserverallocation.md" %}}) from the Kubernetes 
API instead is the preferred pattern. 
This allows Agones to apply your [configured `fleet` scheduling strategy]({{% ref "/docs/Advanced/scheduling-and-autoscaling.md#fleet-scheduling" %}}), potentially resulting in better game server performance or cost savings. Having game servers call `Allocate()` relinquishes control of scheduling 
to another service, which likely doesn't have as much information about your current Kubernetes usage as Agones.

Also, note that `SDK.Allocate()` **does not** guarantee that the `GameServer` moves to the `Allocated` status. Please refer to the warning in the [Function Reference](#function-reference) section above about using the `WatchGameServer()` function.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Shutdown()
Tells Agones to begin the shut down process for the game server which made the API call. The game server state will be set `Shutdown` and the 
backing Pod will be `Terminated`. It is a good idea to make sure you are familiar with the [Termination of Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination)
Kubernetes documentation to understand the termination process and related configuration options.

The recommended approach is to implement a graceful shutdown of your game sever process when it receives the TERM signal. 
Kubernetes will send this signal to your application when the backing Pod transitions to the `Terminated` state.

Be aware that if you call your OS's version of `System.exit(0)` after calling `SDK.Shutdown()`, your game server container may
restart for a brief period, inline with our [Health Checking]({{% ref "/docs/Guides/health-checking.md#health-failure-strategy" %}}) policies. 

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
There are also a number of cases where the SDK server can receive a TERM signal from Kubernetes aside from your game server 
calling SDK.Shutdown(). In those cases, the SDK server will stay alive until the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` period in the SDK server `podSpec` has
elapsed, or until it receives the `SDK.Shutdown()` API request from your game server, whichever comes first.
{{< /alert >}}

### Configuration Retrieval 

#### GameServer()

Returns a useful subset of the `GameServer` configuration and status. This can be useful
when your game server wants to know its Health check configuration, or its IP and Port after moving to 
`Allocated` state, for example.

Since the GameServer contains an entire [PodTemplate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/#pod-templates) (much of which is of limited use to game server applications), 
several parts of the template are omitted, leaving the parts of the template that the community has said they find most useful.  Refer to the `message GameServer` portion of the 
{{% ghlink href="proto/sdk/sdk.proto" %}}`sdk.proto`{{% /ghlink %}} definition file to see what information your game server will receive from this function call. 
If there are missing parts of the template that you'd like access to using this function, please [file an issue](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/issues) or pull request.

For language specific documentation, have a look at client's respective source (linked above) 
and the {{< ghlink href="examples" >}}examples{{< /ghlink >}}.

#### WatchGameServer(function(gameserver){...})

Executes the passed-in callback with the current `GameServer` details whenever the `GameServer` configuration is updated. It returns a useful subset of the `GameServer` configuration and status which allows you to track changes to `GameServer status`, `state`, `metadata`, and more.
When your game server has registered a callback using `WatchGameServer()`,
manipulating metadata such as [Annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) and
[Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) on the `GameServer` object using the Kubernetes API can be a useful way to communicate information to running game server processes 
from outside processes and systems.  This is especially useful when combined with
[metadata applied during
`GameServerAllocation`]({{< ref "/docs/Reference/gameserverallocation.md" >}}).

Since the GameServer contains an entire [PodTemplate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/#pod-templates) (much of which is of limited use to game server applications),

### Metadata Management

#### SetLabel(key, value)

Sets a [Label](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) 
key/value pair on the backing `GameServer` object in Kubernetes. 

To maintain isolation, the `key` value is automatically prefixed with the value **"agones.dev/sdk-"**. This is done for 
two main reasons:
*  The prefix allows the developer to distinguish values the client SDK has permission to write. 
Much like `private` vs `public` scope in a programming language, the Agones SDK only provides write access to `GameServer` labels with this prefix.
*  The prefix limits the attack surface if the GameServer container gets compromised. Since `GameServer` containers are frequently directly exposed to the internet (to optimize multiplayer latency) and Agones doesn't control what runs inside the container, limiting access for compromised pods is worth the extra development friction that comes with having this prefix in place.

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning">}}
Kubernetes has [limits on lengths and which characters are allowed in label keys and values](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set). 
{{< /alert >}}

Setting `GameServer` labels can be useful if you want information from your running game server process to be 
observable or searchable through the Kubernetes API.  

#### SetAnnotation(key, value)

Sets an [Annotation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) key/value pair
on the backing `GameServer` object in Kubernetes. 

To maintain isolation, the `key` value is automatically prefixed with **"agones.dev/sdk-"** for the same reasons as 
in [SetLabel(...)](#setlabelkey-value) above. The isolation is also important as Agones uses annotations on the 
`GameServer` as part of its internal processing.

### Player Tracking

{{< alpha title="Player Tracking" gate="PlayerTracking" >}}

#### Alpha().PlayerConnect(playerID)

Attempts to increment the SDK's stored player count and include the provided playerID in the list stored in `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs`.

If the provided playerID **does not exist** in the playerID list, `PlayerConnect()` increments the count, adds the playerID to the list, and returns true. 

If the provided playerID **does not exist** in the playerID list **but** incrementing the count would exceed the playerID capacity you've configured, `PlayerConnect()` leaves the count and list unchanged, and returns false. 

If the provided playerID **already exists** in the playerID list, `PlayerConnect()` leaves the count and list unchanged, and returns false.

The Kubernetes `GameServer` object fields [`GameServer.Status.Players.Count` and `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs`][playerstatus] are updated by `PlayerConnect()` after a one second delay.  If there is already an update pending, they are combined into a batch operation.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
Do not combine this function with manually managing `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs` and `GameServer.Status.Players.Count`
through the Kubernetes API, as indeterminate results will occur.  
{{< /alert >}}
    
#### Alpha().PlayerDisconnect(playerID)

Attempts to decrement the SDK's stored player count and remove the provided playerID in the list stored in `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs`.

If the provided playerID **exists** in the playerID list, `PlayerDisconnect()` decrements the count, removes the playerID from the list, and returns true. 

If the provided playerID **does not exist** in the playerID list `PlayerDisconnect()` leaves the count and list unchanged, and returns false. 

The Kubernetes `GameServer` object fields [`GameServer.Status.Players.Count` and `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs`][playerstatus] are updated by `PlayerDisconnect()` after a one second delay.  If there is already an update pending, they are combined into a batch operation.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
Do not combine this function with manually managing `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs` and `GameServer.Status.Players.Count`
through the Kubernetes API, as indeterminate results will occur.  
{{< /alert >}}

#### Alpha().SetPlayerCapacity(count)

Updates the [`GameServer.Status.Players.Capacity`][playerstatus] value with a new capacity.

#### Alpha().GetPlayerCapacity()

Retrieves the current player capacity. This is always accurate to what has been set through this SDK,
even if the value has yet to be updated in the `GameServer.Status.Players.Capacity` resource.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
If `GameServer.Status.Players.Capacity` is set manually through the Kubernetes API, use `SDK.GameServer()` or 
`SDK.WatchGameServer()` instead to view this value.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Alpha().GetPlayerCount()

Retrieves the current player count. This is always accurate to what has been set through this SDK, 
even if the value has yet to be updated in the `GameServer.Status.Players` resource.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
If `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs` is set manually through the Kubernetes API, use `SDK.GameServer()` 
or `SDK.WatchGameServer()` instead to retrieve the current player count.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Alpha().IsPlayerConnected(playerID)

Returns if the provided playerID is in the list of playerIDs connected to the GameServer. 
This is always accurate to what has been set through this SDK,
even if the value has yet to be updated in the `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs` resource.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
If `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs` is set manually through the Kubernetes API, use `SDK.GameServer()` 
or `SDK.WatchGameServer()` instead to retrieve the current player count.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Alpha().GetConnectedPlayers()

Returns the list of the currently connected playerIDs. 
This is always accurate to what has been set through this SDK, 
even if the value has yet to be updated in the `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs` resource.

{{< alert title="Note" color="info">}}
If `GameServer.Status.Players.IDs` is set manually through the Kubernetes API, use `SDK.GameServer()` 
or `SDK.WatchGameServer()` instead to retrieve the current player count.

## Writing your own SDK

If there isn't an SDK for the language and platform you are looking for, you have several options:

### gRPC Client Generation

If [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/) client generation is well supported for your language, you can generate client(s) from
the `.proto` files found in the {{% ghlink href="proto/sdk" %}}`proto/sdk`{{% /ghlink %}}, directory.  
You can then reference the current {{< ghlink href="sdks" >}}SDKs{{< /ghlink >}} to see how they wrapped the generated client code to make interaction with the SDK server simpler for the user.

### REST API Implementation

If client generation is not well supported by gRPC, or if there are other complicating factors, implement the SDK through
the [`REST HTTP/JSON`]({{< relref "rest.md" >}}) interface. This could be written by hand, or potentially generated from
the {{< ghlink href="sdks/swagger" >}}Swagger/OpenAPI Specifications{{< /ghlink >}}.

Finally, if you build something that would be useful to the community, please submit a pull request!

## SDK Conformance Test

There is a tool `SDK server Conformance` checker which will run Local SDK server and record all requests your client is performing.

In order to check that SDK is working properly you should write simple SDK test client which would use all methods of your SDK.

Also to test that SDK client is receiving valid Gameserver data, your binary should set the same `Label` value as creation timestamp which you will receive as a result of GameServer() call and `Annotation` value same as gameserver UID received by Watch gameserver callback.

Complete list of endpoints which should be called by your test client is the following:
```
ready,allocate,setlabel,setannotation,gameserver,health,shutdown,watch
```

In order to run this test SDK server locally use:
```
SECONDS=30 make run-sdk-conformance-local
```

Docker container would timeout in 30 seconds and give your the comparison of received requests and expected requests

For instance you could run Go SDK conformance test and see how the process goes: 
```
SDK_FOLDER=go make run-sdk-conformance-test
```

In order to add test client for your SDK, write `sdktest.sh` and `Dockerfile`. Refer to {{< ghlink href="build/build-sdk-images/go" >}}Golang SDK Conformance testing directory structure{{< /ghlink >}}.

## Building the Tools

If you wish to build the binaries from source
the `make` target `build-agones-sdk-binary` will compile the necessary binaries
for all supported operating systems (64 bit windows, linux and osx).

You can find the binaries in the `bin` folder in {{< ghlink href="cmd/sdk-server" >}}`cmd/sdk-server`{{< /ghlink >}}
once compilation is complete.

See {{< ghlink href="build" branch="main" >}}Developing, Testing and Building Agones{{< /ghlink >}} for more details.
